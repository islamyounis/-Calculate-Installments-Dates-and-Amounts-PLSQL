# Calculate Installments' Dates and Amounts PLSQL
PLSQL project to Calculate the installments dates and amounts for contracts
## Project's Description:
PLSQL script that calculates the installments' dates and the amount of each date of a contract. It also handles the first installment. Then, adds all new data to a new table in the database schema.

## Project's Details:

- The PLSQL script creates three tables:
  - ```CONTRACTS``` with columns:
    Contract_ID, Contract_STARTDATE, Contract_ENDDATE, Contract_Total_Fees, Contract_Deposit_Fees, Client_ID, Contract_Payment_Type, and Notes.
  - ```CLIENTS``` With columns: 
    Client_ID, Client_Name, Mobile, Address, and NID
  - ```INSTALLMENTS_PAID``` with columns: 
    Installment_ID, Contract_ID, Installment_Date, Installment_Amount, and Paid.

- Two primary keys that use the PRIMARY KEY constraint are defined.
  - The first one is on the Contract_ID column of the CONTRACTS table.
  - The second one is on the Client_ID column of the CLIENTS table. 

- Two foreign key constraints are used.
  - The first one is between the CONTRACTS and CLIENTS tables, where the client_ID column in the CONTRACTS table references the client_ID column in the CLIENTS table. 
  - The second one is in the INSTALLMENTS_PAID table with the CONTRACTS table in the contract_ID column.

## Tools and Technologies:
- SQL and PLSQL.
- Triggers
- TOAD.
